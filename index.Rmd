## Project Thoughts

I am interested in exploring the the number of conflicts in the Middle East from President Bush to President Trump. I want to explore the difference in conflict onsets as well as the differences in numbers of troops associated with each conflict onset. The goal of this study would be to determine under which presidency was the US most involved in the Middle East.
